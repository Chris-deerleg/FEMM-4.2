to run this file you need Femm 4.2 http://www.femm.info/wiki/Download
DIY-SEM-G01.lua contains object oriented way to build a magnet in the simulation

The file DIY-SEM-G02.lua  is the improved version of the previous one. The new file contains metodes to build a simulation and to palce objects like magnets.
